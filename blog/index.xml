      <description>I havenâ€™t found a good alternative to the Unix uptime command for Windows yet.
 uptime from the procps-ng package
 $ uptime 12:53:36 up 5:03, 1 user, load average: 0.83, 0.61, 0.36 $ uptime --pretty up 5 hours, 3 minutes $ uptime --since 2021-02-17 07:50:35   Tell how long a Windows system has been running For PowerShell version 6+, there is the Get-Uptime cmdlet.
 $ Get-Uptime Days : 30 Hours : 7 Minutes : 33 Seconds : 45 Milliseconds : 0 Ticks : 26192250000000 TotalDays : 30,3151041666667 TotalHours : 727,5625 TotalMinutes : 43653,75 TotalSeconds : 2619225 TotalMilliseconds : 2619225000 $ Get-Uptime -Since Monday, January 18, 2021 7:56:57 AM   If Get-Uptime is not available, you can query the WMI with a CIM cmdlet.</description>

      <description>From String Parse a string representing a date/time in any format to a Python datetime object with the datetime.strptime() method.
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from datetime import datetime &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; timestamp = &amp;#39;01.10.2009 20:36:41&amp;#39; &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; datetime.strptime(timestamp, &amp;#39;%d.%m.%Y %H:%M:%S&amp;#39;) datetime.datetime(2009, 10, 1, 20, 36, 41)   The second argument to datetime.strptime() is a format string build with format codes. See strftime() and strptime() Format Codes for a full list of available format codes.</description>

      <description>You can undo and redo changes without having to press u or CTRL-R repeatedly. Retrieve the state of your buffer as it was some time ago.
 This concept is called undo tree or undo branches. See :help undo-branches.
 Moving through the undo tree Go to older text state (10 minutes before)
 :earlier 10m   Go to newer text state (5 minutes later)
 :later 5m     </description>

      <description>Today I learned how to use PKCS #12 archives with Apache Tomcat for Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS superseded Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
 In the following example, we create a Tomcat TLS connector that uses a PKCS #12 file as Keystore.
 Directory layout ../Tomcat/ ../Tomcat/ | certificates/ | | file.p12 | conf/ | | server.xml   The files file.p12 and server.xml contain the private key and password for a certificate.</description>

      <title>How to Download and Import a Vagrant Box Manually</title>

      <description>Today I learned how to download and import a Vagrant box manually.
 To download or upgrade a Vagrant box, you can use commands like vagrant box add and vagrant box update. Most of the time, you should be fine using these automated processes.
 But sometimes you need more control. Imagine you are working from home and you need to download several huge boxes. You also have lots of video calls with your customers throughout the day, so your priority is to maintain high call quality.</description>
