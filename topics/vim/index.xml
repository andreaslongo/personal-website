      <description>You can undo and redo changes without having to press u or CTRL-R repeatedly. Retrieve the state of your buffer as it was some time ago.
 This concept is called undo tree or undo branches. See :help undo-branches.
 Moving through the undo tree Go to older text state (10 minutes before)
 :earlier 10m   Go to newer text state (5 minutes later)
 :later 5m     </description>
