= Personal Website

image::https://github.com/andreaslongo/personal-website/workflows/Deployment/badge.svg[Deployment]

This repository contains the source code of my website https://www.andreaslongo.com[andreaslongo.com].

It's built with https://gohugo.io[Hugo], a https://jamstack.org/generators[static site generator], and hosted on https://pages.github.com[GitHub Pages].

== Editing

The content gets written in https://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoc / Asciidoctor] format.

To get a live preview of the website, launch a local Hugo server:

`hugo server`

It will build and serve the site via Hugo's webserver.
The site gets automatically rebuild if you change a file.

Useful options are
`--buildDrafts` to include content marked as draft,
`--buildFuture` to add content with publishdate in the future
and `--debug` for debugging output.

== Deployment

Deployment to GitHub Pages happens automatically via https://github.com/features/actions[GitHub Actions] when a new tag gets pushed to the repository.
