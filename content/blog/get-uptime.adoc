I was looking for a `uptime` like command for Windows.

.The `uptime` command on Linux:
[source, shell]
----
$ uptime
12:53:36 up  5:03,  1 user,  load average: 0.83, 0.61, 0.36

$ uptime --pretty
up 5 hours, 3 minutes

$ uptime --since
2021-02-17 07:50:35
----

On Windows, there is the cmdlet {url_get_uptime}[`Get-Uptime`] which is available for {url_powershell}[PowerShell] version 6+.

[source, shell]
----
$ Get-Uptime -Since
Monday, January 18, 2021 7:56:57 AM
----

If `Get-Uptime` is not available, you can query the WMI with a CIM cmdlet.

[source, shell]
----
$ Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_OperatingSystem | Select-Object LastBootUpTime

LastBootUpTime
--------------
18.01.2021 07:56:41
----

The `LastBootUpTime` value may not be updated if you have _fast boot/startup_ enabled for your system.
