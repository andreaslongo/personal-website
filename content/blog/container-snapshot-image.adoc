You can save the state of a running container as a new image.
This is somewhat similar to "creating a snapshot" when working with virtual machines.

If you use Docker, just replace `podman` with `docker` in the below commands.

$ podman container commit <container name or id> <new-image:tag>
$ podman container commit ansible ansible:2022-04-11
