You can use the _SQL Server Configuration Manager_ to configure an alias for connections to a MSSQL instance.

But on some versions of Windows, the configuration manager is not available as a regular application.
You might find it as a snap-in for the _Microsoft Management Console (MMC)_.

If the configuration manager is generally not available on your system, you can instead use this tools to set an alias:

C:\Windows\System32\cliconfg.exe

# 32 bit version
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\cliconfg.exe
