To use the Windows clipboard in {url_vim}[Vim] on {url_cygwin}[Cygwin], add the following to your Vim config file.

.`.vimrc`
----
set clipboard=unnamed
----

Vim will now use the clipboard register `\*` for yank, delete, change and put operations.
The `*` register gets synced with the Windows clipboard automatically.
