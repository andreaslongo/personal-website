To my knowledge, there is no equivalent to the Unix https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_(command)[`watch`] command for PowerShell on Windows.
But you can get similar behavior:

----
# Similar to `watch <command>`
PS> while ($true) {<your command>; sleep -Seconds 2}

PS> while ($true) {(Get-Service -Name 'Remote Desktop Services').Status; sleep -Seconds 2}
Running
Running
----

If you want to follow log file outputs like with the famous Unix https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_(Unix)[`tail`] command:

----
# Similar to `tail --follow <filename>`
PS> Get-Content -Path <logfile> -Tail 10 –Wait

PS> Get-Content -Path 'C:\app.log' -Tail 10 –Wait
