You can retrieve the state of your text as it was some time ago.
This concept is called *undo tree* or *undo branches*.


== Moving through the undo tree

Go to newer/older text state.

----
g+
g-
----

Go to older text state, 10 minutes before.

----
:earlier 10m
----

Go to newer text state, 5 minutes later.

----
:later 5m
----

Using `g-` and `g+` will get you to all possible text states while repeating `u` and `CTRL-R` does not.

See also `:help undo-branches`.
