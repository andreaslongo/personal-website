You can save the state of a running container as a new image.
This is somewhat similar to "creating a snapshot" when working with virtual machines.

If you use Docker, just replace 'podman' with 'docker' in the below commands.

----
podman container commit <container> <new-image:tag>
podman container commit ansible ansible:snapshot.1
----

There is also a shorthand form of the command which does the same.

----
podman commit <container> <new-image:tag>
----
