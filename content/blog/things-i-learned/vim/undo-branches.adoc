You can undo and redo changes without having to press `u` or `CTRL-R` repeatedly.
Retrieve the state of your buffer as it was some time ago.

This concept is called *undo tree* or *undo branches*.
See `:help undo-branches`.

== Moving through the undo tree

Go to older text state (10 minutes before)

----
:earlier 10m
----

Go to newer text state (5 minutes later)

----
:later 5m
