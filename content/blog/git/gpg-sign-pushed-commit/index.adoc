You have created a pull request (PR) with a single commit on GitHub.
The commit is not GPG-signed.
The maintainer asked you to sign the commit.

If you are the only one working (committing) to this PR, you can force-push a signed commit.

----
# Sign the latest commit on your local repository
git commit --amend --no-edit --gpg-sign

# Force push the commit to your remote repository (fork)
git push --force-with-lease
----

GitHub will automatically update your PR.
