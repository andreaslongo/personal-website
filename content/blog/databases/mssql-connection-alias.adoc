You can use *SQL Server Configuration Manager* to configure an alias for connections to a Microsoft SQL Server instance.

On some versions of Windows, SQL Server Configuration Manager does not appear as an application but as a snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console (MMC). Have a look there if you can't find it.

If the tool is indeed not present, you can use another GUI utility which is generally available on most Windows machines.
