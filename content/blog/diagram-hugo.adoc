https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc[Asciidoctor], has good support for diagrams with the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/diagram-extension/latest/[Diagram] plugin.

To make this work with https://gohugo.io[Hugo], a static site generator, you need:

- a working `asciidoctor-diagram` plugin
- some settings in your https://github.com/andreaslongo/asciidoctor-diagram-hugo-docsy/blob/400041ffeee7a007f99a59d2c5a326e7e762b21e/config.yaml#L5-L10[Hugo site config]

Then run `hugo --destination public` to generate your site including all diagrams.
Have a look at my https://github.com/andreaslongo/asciidoctor-diagram-hugo-docsy[example repository] to get an idea of how this works.
